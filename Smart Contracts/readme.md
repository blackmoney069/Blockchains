In this folder we will use the tools and skills to deploy the smart contracts on the blockchain we have developed and deployed so far.

The tools used are the following:
-  Ganache
- myetherwallet
- Remix Solidity IDE 


We first downloaded the zip file of the ether wallet and then placed it into the smart contracts folder. We used the remix ide to create our first smart contract that is the ICO of the previously created coin (here bainscoin).
 
The solidity file is uploaded in the folder itself. It has a few public variables like:
- circulating Supply
- maximum supply
And some functions like:
- buy bainscoins
- sell bainscoins
- find the equity in USD of a investor address
- find the equity in bainscoins of a investor address

we will deploy this contract on the localhost blockchain and will use ganache to look into the transanctions and blocks as they are mined.

After deploying the contract we can interact with the contract using the MEW as well.
