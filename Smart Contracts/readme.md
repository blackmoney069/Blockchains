In this folder we will use the tools and skills to deploy the smart contracts on the blockchain we have developed and deployed so far.

The tools used are the following:
-  Ganache
- myetherwallet
- Remix Solidity IDE 


We first downloaded the zip file of the ether wallet and then placed it into the smart contracts folder. We used the remix ide to create our first smart contract that is the ICO of the previously created coin (here bainscoin).
