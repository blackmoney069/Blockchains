This is the basic blockchain structure that we will be working on.

THis project is divided in phases and are derived from the udemy course on blockchains called "Blockchains A-Z". THose phases are:
1. Creating a basic blockchain strucutre with the mentioned features.
2. Decentralising that blockchain and then creating a cryptocurrency.
3. Deploying smart contracts on the blockchains either the ethereum mainnet or any other network.

We will use the following tools and languages:
1. Python in Spyder
2. Postman
3. Remix Browser IDE for Solidity
